Felonius my old friend 
Step on in and let me shake your hand 
So glad that you're here again 
For one more time 
Let your madness run with mine 
Streets still unseen we'll find somehow 
No time is better than now 
!
Tell me where are you driving 
Midnight cruiser 
Where is your bounty 
Of fortune and fame 
I am another 
Gentlemen loser 
Drive me to Harlem 
Or somewhere the same 
!
The world that we used to know 
People tell me it don't turn no more 
The places we used to go 
Familiar faces that ain't smilin' like before 
The time of our time has come and gone 
I fear we been waiting too long 
!
Your everlasting summer 
You can see it fading fast 
So you grab a piece of something 
That you think is gonna last 
You wouldn't know a diamond 
If you held it in your hand 
The things you think are precious 
I can't understand 
Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 
!
You been tellin' me you're a genius 
Since you were seventeen 
In all the time I've known you 
I still don't know what you mean 
The weekend at the college 
Didn't turn out like you planned 
The things that pass for knowledge 
I can't understand 
I spend a lot of money 
And I spent a lot of time 
The trip we made in Hollywood 
Is etched upon my mind 
After all the things we've done and seen 
You find another man 
The things you think are useless 
I can't understand 
!
Way back when
In Sixty-seven
I was the dandy 
Of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston 
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale 
Where the hell am I
Hey Nineteen
No we can't dance together
No we can't talk at all
Please take me along 
When you slide on down
!
Hey Nineteen 
That's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember 
The Queen of Soul
It's hard times befallen 
The sole survivors
She thinks I'm crazy 
But I'm just growing old
!
Hey Nineteen
No we got nothing in common
No we can't talk at all
Please take me along 
When you slide on down
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
No we can't dance together
No we can't talk at all
!
Outside the stadium
Special delivery 
For Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma 
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good 
He's a crowd pleasing man
One on one 
He's schoolyard superman
Crashing the backboard 
He's Jungle Jim again
When it's all over 
We'll make some calls from my car
We're a star
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter 
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun
!
All aboard 
The Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados 
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar 
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel 
With his Eurasian bride
On the town 
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers 
Is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness while they danced
I'm the one
!
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter 
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun
Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
That's my claim to fame
Jive Miguel 
He's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight 
At Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings 
After the deal has been done
I'm the one
!

Son you better be ready for love
On this glory day 
This is your chance to believe
What I've got to say
Keep your eyes on the sky
Put a dollar in the kitty 
Don't the moon look pretty
!
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water will change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
I am holding the mystical sphere
It's direct from Lhasa 
Where people are rolling in the snow
Far from the world we know
Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face
!

Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water will change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
I never seen you looking so bad my funky one
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone
!
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend 
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again 
When the demon is at your door 
In the morning it won't be there no more 
Any major dude will tell you
Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times
I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you
!
Got a feeling I've been here before
Watching as you cross the killing floor
You know you'll have to pay it all
You'll pay today or pay tomorrow
You fasten up your beaded gown
Then you try to tie me down
Do you work it out one by one 
Or played in combination
You throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
I have seen your iron and your brass
Can't you see it shine behind the glass
Your fortune is your roving eye
Your mouth and legs
Your gift for the runaround
Torture is the main attraction
I don't need that kind of action
You don't have to dance for me
I've seen your dance before
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
!
Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the Year of the Locust
You'll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
There's one roulade she can't sing
Dumb luck my friend
Won't suck me in this time
!
Got a feeling I've been here before
Won't you let me help you find the door
All you got to do is use
Your silver shoes
A gift for the runaround
Use your knack darlin'
Take one step back darlin'
There ain't nothing in Chicago
For a monkey woman to do
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
!
On the water down in New Orleans
My baby's the pearl of the quarter
She's a charmer like you never seen 
Singing voulez vous
Where the sailor spend his hard-earned pay
Red beans and rice for a quarter
You can see her almost any day
singing voulez vous
And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I love her so 
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
!
I walked alone down the miracle mile
I met my baby by the shine of the martyr
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
Singing voulez vous
She loved the million dollar words I say
She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her
She said she loved me and was on her way
Singing voulez vous
!
I've seen your picture 
Your name in lights above it 
This is your big debut 
It's like a dream come true 
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it 
I like your pin shot 
I keep it with your letter 
Done up in blueprint blue 
It sure looks good on you 
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better 
Peg
It will come back to you 
Then the shutter falls 
You see it all in 3-D 
It's your favorite foreign movie
!
While the music played you worked by candlelight 
Those San Francisco nights 
You were the best in town 
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl 
You turned it on the world 
That's when you turned the world around
Did you feel like Jesus 
Did you realize 
That you were a champion in their eyes
!
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene 
But yours was kitchen clean 
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home 
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall 
You must have had it all 
You'd go to L.A. on a dare 
And you'd go it alone 
Could you live forever 
Could you see the day 
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away
Get along, get along Kid Charlemagne 
Get along Kid Charlemagne
!
Now your patrons have all left you in the red 
Your low rent friends are dead 
This life can be very strange 
All those dayglow freaks who used to paint the face 
They've joined the human race 
Some things will never change 
Son you were mistaken 
You are obsolete 
Look at all the white men on the street
!
Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail 
Those test tubes and the scale 
Just get them all out of here 
Is there gas in the car 
Yes, there's gas in the car 
I think the people down the hall 
Know who you are
Careful what you carry 
'Cause the man is wise 
You are still an outlaw in their eyes
!
A race of angels 
Bound with one another 
A dish of dollars 
Laid out for all to see 
A tower room at Eden Rock 
His golf at noon for free 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 
His lady's aching 
To bring a body down 
She daily preaches 
On where she wants to be 
An evening with a movie queen 
A face we all have seen 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 
A case of aces 
Done up loose for dealing 
A piece of island cooling in the sea 
The whole of time we gain or lose 
And power enough to choose 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me
!
This is the day 
Of the expanding man 
That shape is my shade 
There where I used to stand 
It seems like only yesterday 
I gazed through the glass 
At ramblers 
Wild gamblers 
That's all in the past 
You call me a fool 
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real 
I already bought the dream 
So useless to ask me why 
Throw a kiss and say goodbye 
I'll make it this time 
I'm ready to cross that fine line 
!
I'll learn to work the saxophone 
I'll play just what I feel 
Drink Scotch whisky all night long 
And die behind the wheel 
They got a name for the winners in the world 
I want a name when I lose 
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide 
Call me Deacon Blues 
My back to the wall 
A victim of laughing chance 
This is for me 
The essence of true romance 
Sharing the things we know and love 
With those of my kind 
Libations 
Sensations
That stagger the mind 
!
I crawl like a viper 
Through these suburban streets 
Make love to these women 
Languid and bittersweet 
I'll rise when the sun goes down 
Cover every game in town 
A world of my own 
I'll make it my home sweet home 
This is the night
Of the expanding the man 
I take one last drag 
As I approach the stand 
I cried when I wrote this song 
Sue me if I play too long 
This brother is free 
I'll be what I want to be
!
Just when I say
"Boy we can't miss
You are golden"
Then you do this
You say this guy is so cool
Snapping his fingers like a fool
One more expensive kiss-off
Who do you think I am
Lord I know you're a special friend
But you don't seem to understand
We got heavy rollers
I think you should know
Try again tomorrow
!
Can't you see they're laughing at me
Get rid off him
I don't care what you do at home 
Would you care to explain
Who is the gaucho amigo
Why is he standing
In your spangled leather poncho
And your elevator shoes
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend
Will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome
What I tell you
Back down the line
I'll scratch your back
You can scratch mine
No he can't sleep on the floor
What do you think I'm yelling for
I'll drop him near the freeway
Doesn't he have a home
!
Lord I know you're a special friend
But you refuse to understand
You're a nasty schoolboy
With no place to go
Try again tomorrow
Don't tell me he'll wait in the car
Look at you
Holding hands with the man from Rio
Would you care to explain
!
Who is the gaucho amigo
Why is he standing
In your spangled leather poncho
With the studs that match your eyes
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend
Will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome
!
The wind was driving in my face
The smell of prickly pear
My rival - show me my rival
The milk truck eased into my space
Somebody screamed somewhere
I struck a match against the door
Of Anthony's Bar and Grill 
I was the whining stranger
A fool in love
With time to kill
I've got detectives on his case
They filmed the whole charade
My rival - show me my rival
He's got a scar across his face
He wears a hearing aid
!
Sure he's a jolly roger
Until he answers for his crime
Yes I'll match him whim for whim now
I still recall when I first held
Your tiny hand in mine
My rival - show me my rival
I loved you more than I can tell
But now it's stomping time
Sure he's a jolly roger
Until he answers for his crime
Yes I'll match him whim for whim now
